We aim to solve the problem of efficiency in emergency response utilizing the cognitive capabilities of Watson.

The main problems with 911 calls are the understaffing of call centers and the wasted communication in trying to pinpoint an address through phone carriers. 

Our project takes full advantage of Watson APIs to optimize a call in real time -- namely the capabilities of speech to text,  tone analysis, natural language understanding, and Watson Conversation.
